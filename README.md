# Electron_TypeScript_Boilerplate
This is a working workspace for an minimal Electron App written entirely in TypeScript 2.0 ES6 without any vanilla JS code.

Four main steps are required to run this (besides a functional Node.js installation)

1. Close this repository, fire up your IDE and navigate to the unpacked folder
2. Run `npm install` to get all the (dev-) dependencies installed, that are defined inside the provided package.json file
3. Run `npm run electron-prebuild` to rebuild electron so that it matches your Node.js version
4. Run `npm start` to fire up the App

More information will be provided if asked for! :-D

This repository is mainly for myself, so that I don't have to start all over again this painful process...
